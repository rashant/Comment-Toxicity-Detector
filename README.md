# Comment-Toxicity-Detector
The model is build using embedding and bidirectional LSTM layer with 3 fully connected layers. For the training I have used the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset. The model used text vectorization process for text preprocessing. Even though the model is trained for only one epoch the accuracy results are pretty good. 
The model is run on gradio interface where we can input the comment and the toxicity level detection will be seen as output.
